Hi there!  This is the personal website of Brandon Castellano (sometimes known as Breakthrough).  Here, you can find my blog, technical articles, and various projects (software & hardware) I’m working on.
<br /><br />
As for my background, I hold a B.E.Sc in Electrical Engineering, with the majority of my professional experience in the areas of robotics and real-time control systems.  I’m “fluent” in a wide variety of programming languages, my favourites being C++, Python, and C# (although I’ve worked with Assembly, C, PHP, and Go).  For the curious, I’m both a Windows and Linux user (with Xubuntu being my desktop distribution of choice at the moment, and Debian-based for embedded ARM systems).
<br /><br />
Below you can find a list of my professional/academic experience, some of my accounts across the web, and methods to contact me.

## My Background & Experience

### Employers

The following is a list of companies I have worked for in the past (note this list may not always be up to date):


 - [**Eagle Vision Systems**](http://eaglevisionsystems.com/)
   - *Engineering Manager*, Product Development
   - Design and implementation of a system to allow automated waste/recycling collection for vehicles with external hydraulic arms
   - Assigned/authored patent (see below) for overall process, with real-world testing being performed currently<br /><br />

 - [**University of Western Ontario**](http://uwo.ca/)
   - *Research Assistant*, Robotic Mushroom Farming
   - Tasked with development of the stereoscopic/3D camera hardware required for generating a depth map of mushrooms farm
   - Depth map used to resolve/estimate location, size, and pose of individual mushrooms, to be harvested by a robotic manipulator<br /><br />

 - [**Ontario Power Generation**](http://www.opg.com/)

 - [**Toronto Hydro Corporation**](http://www.torontohydro.com)


### Education

I hold a **B.E.Sc in Electrical Engineering** from the [*University of Western Ontario*](http://uwo.ca/).  The focus of my studies was real-time and embedded control systems, with significant overlap in the areas of computer engineering and computer science.  I also have experience taking post-graduate courses in parallel processing and GPGPU optimization, and have applied these skills to real-world robotic systems, mainly using image processing for object and pose recognition.

### Patents

The following is a list of patents I have authored/co-authored:

 - [**US9403278B1: Systems and methods for detecting and picking up a waste receptacle** (link)](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9403278B1)
   - Patent covers the use of sensors and/or computer vision to allow automated control of a hydraulic arm on waste collection vehicles, allowing for a much faster pickup cycle, reduction in driver workload and training requirements, and improved overall safety via greater spatial awareness
   - Co-authored patent as part of my work for Eagle Vision Systems, where a successful implementation of the system was developed
   - The initial development implementation was successful, with real-world testing currently ongoing

### Literature

Based on my experience with image processing, especially in the areas of Python and OpenCV, I have participated in the development of the following published books:

 - [**Learning OpenCV 3 Computer Vision with Python** - Second Edition (link)](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-opencv-3-computer-vision-python-second-edition), Packt Publishing
   - *Role*: selected as final reviewer, tasked with verifying and/or rewriting code samples for the new edition to comply with the latest version of OpenCV
   - *Authors*: Joe Minichino, Joseph Howse
   - *Publish Date*: September 2015

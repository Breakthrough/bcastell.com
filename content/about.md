Hi there!  This is the personal website of Brandon Castellano (sometimes known as Breakthrough).  Here, you can find my blog, technical articles, and various projects (software & hardware) Iâ€™m working on.
<br /><br />
I'm a software engineer with experience developing for real-time and embedded systems.  The languages I have the most experience with are C/C++, Rust, and Python, but I'm also proficient in many others. This includes Go, Dart, and C#, and I'm always interested in learning new languages (Zig). I'm comfortable with Windows/Linux/OSX, as well as developing on specialized hardware and new platforms.

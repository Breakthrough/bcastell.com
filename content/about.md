Hi there!  This is the personal website of Brandon Castellano (sometimes known as Breakthrough).  Here, you can find my blog, technical articles, and various projects (software & hardware) I’m working on.
<br /><br />
As for my background, I hold a B.E.Sc in Electrical Engineering, with the majority of my professional experience in the areas of robotics and real-time control systems.  I’m “fluent” in a wide variety of programming languages, my favourites being C++, Python, and C# (although I’ve worked with Assembly, C, PHP, and Go).  For the curious, I’m both a Windows and Linux user (with Xubuntu being my desktop distribution of choice at the moment, and Debian-based for embedded ARM systems).
<br /><br />
Below you can find a list of my professional/academic experience, some of my accounts across the web, and methods to contact me.

## My Background & Experience


### Education

I hold a **B.E.Sc in Electrical Engineering** from the [*University of Western Ontario*](http://uwo.ca/).  The focus of my studies was real-time and embedded control systems, with significant overlap in the areas of computer engineering and computer science.  I also have experience taking post-graduate courses in parallel processing and GPGPU optimization, having applied these skills to real-world robotic systems, mainly focused on using image processing for object and pose recognition.

### Employers and Start-ups

The following is a list of companies I have worked for in the past, or have been on professional terms with, in no particular order:

 - [**Eagle Vision Systems**](http://eaglevisionsystems.com/)
   - *Engineering Manager*, Product Development
     - Design and implementation of a system to allow automated waste/recycling collection for vehicles with external hydraulic arms
     - Assigned/authored patent (see below) for overall process, with real-world testing being performed currently
     - Technologies used include C++, Python, OpenCV, SDL/OpenGL, CAN/Serial interfaces to sensor and hydraulic controllers, USB CMOS cameras, a Linux-based operating system, and the Nvidia Jetson platform for future GPGPU acceleration, along with a physical touchscreen display for operator feedback and system monitoring<br /><br />

 - [**University of Western Ontario**](http://uwo.ca/)
   - *Research Assistant*, Robotic Mushroom Farming
     - Tasked with development of the stereoscopic/3D camera hardware required for generating a depth map of mushrooms farm
     - Depth map used to resolve/estimate location, size, and pose of individual mushrooms, to be harvested by a robotic manipulator<br />
   - *Teaching Assistant*, Software Engineering SE2250: Software Construction
     - Helped students during lab hours with course fundamentals, and graded projects, tests, and exams
     - Involved teaching of Git, C++, and Qt, and other utilities to demonstrate Linux-based development using command-line tools
     - Final project involved building an interactive Puzzle Bobble-like game utilizing path planning and collision detection<br /><br />

 - [**Ontario Power Generation**](http://www.opg.com/)
   - *Market Operations*, Portfolio Management
     - Tasked with creating an extensive reporting tool to determine the costs incurred when using generators to provide voltage support, as well as optimize the operation of the generator facilities for a significant saving in costs
     - Performed weekly audit of hydroelectric generating station water usage, and implemented various optimizations and enhancements to the existing auditing system
     - Performed daily data scraping and reporting of fuel cost inputs, for analysis and forecasting models to estimate electricity pricing and costs
     - Much of the technologies involved include Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, VBA, SQL, and some Java tools

 - [**Toronto Hydro Corporation**](http://www.torontohydro.com)
   - *Capacity Planning*, Records Management
     - Created internal tools to assist with parsing large amounts of data used by the asset management/tracking and geographical information systems (GIS)
     - Assisted in the creation of a power systems training course (related to substation design) for employees focused or with backgrounds in related engineering roles
     - Wrote various data analysis and reporting applications using C# and the .NET Framework, including the Microsoft Office interop assemblies

### Patents

The following is a list of patents I have authored/co-authored:

 - [**US9403278B1: Systems and methods for detecting and picking up a waste receptacle** (link)](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9403278B1)
   - Patent covers the use of sensors and/or computer vision to allow automated control of a hydraulic arm on waste collection vehicles, allowing for a much faster pickup cycle, reduction in driver workload and training requirements, and improved overall safety via greater spatial awareness
   - Co-authored patent as part of my work for Eagle Vision Systems, where a successful implementation of the system was developed
   - The initial development implementation was successful, with real-world testing currently ongoing

### Literature

Based on my experience with image processing, especially in the areas of Python and OpenCV, I have participated in the development of the following published books:

 - [**Learning OpenCV 3 Computer Vision with Python** - Second Edition (link)](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-opencv-3-computer-vision-python-second-edition), Packt Publishing
   - *Role*: selected as final reviewer, tasked with verifying and/or rewriting code samples for the new edition to comply with the latest version of OpenCV
   - *Authors*: Joe Minichino, Joseph Howse
   - *Publish Date*: September 2015

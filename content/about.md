Hi there!  This is the personal website of Brandon Castellano (sometimes known as Breakthrough).  Here, you can find my blog, technical articles, and various projects (software & hardware) I’m working on.

As for my background, I hold a B.E.Sc in Electrical Engineering, and am pursuing a M.E.Sc in Robotics and Control.  I’m “fluent” in a wide variety of programming languages, my favourites being C++, Python, and C# (although I’ve worked with Assembly, C, and PHP).  And for the curious, I’m both a Windows and Linux user (Xubuntu being my distribution of choice at the moment).

## Contact Me

I’m still sorting out the best method of contact if you should need to get in touch with me.  For now, leave a comment on this page.

## Across The Web

You can find me at the following websites:

    Super User (Breakthrough)

## Overview

PySceneDetect is a command-line application and a Python library for detecting scene changes in videos, automatically splitting the video into separate clips. Not only is it free and open-source software (FOSS), but there are several detection methods available (see Features), from simple threshold-based fade in/out detection, to advanced content aware fast-cut detection.

## Documentation

There is extensive documentation available for PySceneDetect on Read the Docs at [pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io](http://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  This includes a [getting started guide](http://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/usage/), examples, and an overview of the Python API.  Note that while the Python API is still unstable, and subject to change in subsequent releases (this does not affect the main command-line program).

## Triclysm

--------

### Project Overview

See the Triclysm project on Github at the following URL: [https://github.com/Triclysm](https://github.com/Triclysm)

### Triclysm Previewer

[Triclysm Previewer (link)](https://github.com/Triclysm/Previewer-Legacy) is a cross-platform application for developing, previewing, and streaming (via Ethernet or Wi-Fi) to a physical LED cube/voxel-based display.  Cross-platform, written in C++, using SDL/OpenGL as a back-end, with Lua as the primary scripting language for animations.

In the future, a rewrite is planned, utilizing Python for a majority of the code, and allowing it to be used for animation development as well.  However, the existing code-base has been successfully tested on an 8x8x8 monochrome LED cube (giving 1024 total levels of brightness at the maximum refresh rate), as well as a 4x4x4 RGB LED cube, with a total of 4096 individual colour combinations.

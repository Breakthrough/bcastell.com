## Triclysm

Project Overview:  [https://github.com/Triclysm](https://github.com/Triclysm)

[Triclysm Previewer (link)](https://github.com/Triclysm/Previewer-Legacy): cross-platform software for developing, previewing, and streaming (via Ethernet or Wi-Fi) to a physical LED cube/voxel-based display.  Cross-platform, written in C++, using SDL/OpenGL as a back-end, with Lua as the primary scripting language for animations.

In the future, a rewrite is planned, utilizing Python for a majority of the code, and allowing it to be used for animation development as well.

### Overview

DVR-Scan is a command-line application for detecting areas in a video that contain motion, automatically extracting each motion segment as a separate file for further viewing or processing.  This makes managing a large amount of footage from, for example, security cameras/DVRs, a much more manageable task, as only the areas of interest need to be reviewed after processing with DVR-Scan.

See [DVR-Scan on Readthedocs](http://dvr-scan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

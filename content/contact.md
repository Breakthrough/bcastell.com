## Location & Contact Information

For serious/professional inquiries, feel free to use the contact form below, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

If you need to get in touch with me about a particular post/project, feel free to leave a comment on that particular [post](/posts)/[project](/projects) page.  Lastly, you can also contact me through any of my other official accounts/services listed on <a href="{{< relref "about.md" >}}">the About page</a> (under the "Across The Web" section).

This is especially preferred in regards to any bug reports or feature requests, which should be submitted as an issue on the relevant project's Github Issues page.

Note that I am currently in the Greater Toronto Area.  The map below is at a location near-by, but not exactly, where I reside.  In the past, I have also lived in London and Guelph, both for academic, and professional/work-relatd purposes.  For potential employers/contracts, I am flexible in terms of location, remote work, and if necessary, relocation.

## Location and Contact Me

If you should need to get in touch with me, the quickest way would be to leave a comment on [any posts](/posts).  You can also contact me through any of my other official accounts/services listed on <a href="{{< relref "about.md" >}}">the About page</a> (under the "Across The Web" section).

Lastly, the below contact form can be used to contact me for serious inquiries.  Right now it is a work-in-progress, but this message will be removed once it has been verified as working.

Note that I am currently in the Greater Toronto Area.  The map below is at a location near-by, but not exactly, where I reside.  In the past, I have also lived in London and Guelph, both for academic, and professional/work-relatd purposes.  For potential employers/contracts, I am flexible in terms of location, remote work, and if necessary, relocation.

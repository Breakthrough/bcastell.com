### PySceneDetect &#x1f3a5;
</a>

PySceneDetect is a command-line application and a Python library for detecting scene changes in videos, automatically splitting the video into separate clips. Not only is it free and open-source software (FOSS), but there are several detection methods available (see Features), from simple threshold-based fade in/out detection, to advanced content aware fast-cut detection.

### DVR-Scan <img src="/img/projects/dvr-scan/logo_small.png" alt="DVR-Scan Logo"/>

</a>

DVR-Scan is a cross-platform command-line (CLI) application that automatically detects motion events in video files (e.g. security camera footage). In addition to locating both the time and duration of each motion event, DVR-Scan will save the footage of each motion event to a new, separate video clip. Not only is DVR-Scan free and open-source software (you can find DVR-Scan on Github), it's written in Python, based on Numpy and OpenCV, and was built to be extendable and hackable.

### Biopsy Bot &#x1f52c;
</a>

A remote-control robot capable of gathering a biological sample in unknown areas, Biopsy Bot was developed as a final project for the Mechatronic System Design course offered at [UWO](http://www.uwo.ca). The purpose of the project was to develop a robot capable of remotely navigating (with the aid of an on-board wireless camera) an area of unknown obstacles and rocky terrain, in order to gather and return a biological sample from a mysterious blob (made of Jello).

### Triclysm <img src="/img/triclysm-screenshot-00.png" alt="Triclysm SCreenshot" width="64"/>
</a>

A 3D LED display project, including hardware (electrical schematics, components, and microcontroller firmware) and software to develop and wirelessly transmit 3D videos/animations to the display.  The design is extendable, with the default configuration supporting a greyscale 8x8x8/512 voxel or 4096-colour RGB 4x4x4/64 voxel display.

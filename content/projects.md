The following is a collection of some of my favourite and most popular projects.  For a full list of projects you can checkout my profile on Github, alhough this also includes experimental and testing software as well.  The software listead below shows more developed projects with a wider user-base.

## PySceneDetect &#x1f3a5;
</a>

PySceneDetect is a command-line application and a Python library for detecting scene changes in videos, automatically splitting the video into separate clips. Not only is it free and open-source software (FOSS), but there are several detection methods available (see Features), from simple threshold-based fade in/out detection, to advanced content aware fast-cut detection.

## DVR-Scan &#x1f4fc;
</a>

DVR-Scan is a cross-platform command-line (CLI) application that automatically detects motion events in video files (e.g. security camera footage). In addition to locating both the time and duration of each motion event, DVR-Scan will save the footage of each motion event to a new, separate video clip. Not only is DVR-Scan free and open-source software (you can find DVR-Scan on Github), it's written in Python, based on Numpy and OpenCV, and was built to be extendable and hackable.

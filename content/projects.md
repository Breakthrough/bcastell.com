</a>

<a href="{{< relref "projects/Triclysm.md" >}}">Triclysm</a> is 3D LED display project, including hardware (electrical schematics, components, and microcontroller firmware) and software to develop and wirelessly transmit 3D videos/animations to the display.  The design is extendable, with the default configuration supporting a greyscale 8x8x8/512 voxel or 4096-colour RGB 4x4x4/64 voxel display.

</a>

A remote-control robot capable of gathering a biological sample in unknown areas, <a href="{{< relref "projects/BiopsyBot.md" >}}">Biopsy Bot</a> was developed as a final project for the Mechatronic System Design course offered at [UWO](http://www.uwo.ca). The purpose of the project was to develop a robot capable of remotely navigating (with the aid of an on-board wireless camera) an area of unknown obstacles and rocky terrain, in order to gather and return a biological sample from a mysterious blob (made of Jello).

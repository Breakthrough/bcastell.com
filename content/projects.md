### PySceneDetect &#x1f3a5;
</a>
PySceneDetect is a scene/shot detection tool and Python library. It is free and open source software, used in both industry and academia. Example applications include preprocessing video data for training AI models, developing plugins for non-linear video editors, and research analysis of film. PySceneDetect was built to be extensible, and easily integrates into most workflows.

### Biopsy Bot &#x1f52c;
</a>

A remote-control robot capable of gathering a biological sample in unknown areas, <a href="{{< relref "projects/BiopsyBot.md" >}}">Biopsy Bot</a> was developed as a final project for the Mechatronic System Design course offered at [UWO](http://www.uwo.ca). The purpose of the project was to develop a robot capable of remotely navigating (with the aid of an on-board wireless camera) an area of unknown obstacles and rocky terrain, in order to gather and return a biological sample from a mysterious blob (made of Jello).

  <p>There are some languages and platforms/libraries I have gained significant experience using over the years, as well as the use of similar or competing technologies.  Much of my industry experience is with designing real-time robotics and/or computer-vision related systems, using C/C++ or Python, distributing for the Linux or Windows platforms (usually both, including compatibility for OS X as well).</p>
  <p>I have also designed and implemented user interfaces for robotics and computer vision systems.  These include logistical and database applications using either Gtk+/PyGTK and Glade, or Qt4/5 (depending on the source language and project technology requirements).  I also have experience using SDL and OpenGL for implementing real-time hardware accelerated overlays for multiple video streams.</p>

description: "There are some languages and platforms/libraries I have gained significant experience using over the years, as well as the use of similar or competing technologies.  Much of my experience is with designing real-time robotics and/or computer-vision related systems, using C/C++ or Python, distributing for the Linux or Windows platforms (usually both, including compatibility for OS X as well)."

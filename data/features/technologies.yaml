  The languages I have the most experience with are C/C++, Rust, and Python, but I'm also proficient in many others. This includes Go, Dart, and C#, and I'm always interested in learning new languages (Zig).<br/><br/>I'm comfortable with Windows/Linux/OSX, as well as developing on specialized hardware and new platforms.
